					Get your recommendation without revealing your privacy! Our "Playlist
					Tuning" feature only looks at the playlist link you provide. From
					there, we conduct content-based filtering to find similarities between
					tracks in your playlist and other songs in our database to give you
					recommendations on tracks that you might like. You can also choose the
					number of tracks that you would like to receive. Note that no user
					data - including user profile, regions, etc. are collected for THIS
					feature.

					This site provides you with several features to find new music and
					create playlist in an easy fashion. First, enter up to 5 song names or
					artists that you want the playlist to reflect. Second, set the
					tuneable attributes that you want to highlight in your playlist. This
					includes attributes such as energy, which measures the intensity of
					music, and valence, which describes the mood of the track.
					Non-selected attributes will have no effect on the generated playlist.
					Note that user authentication OAuth2 from Spotify API and SoundCloud
					are required for THIS feature.
